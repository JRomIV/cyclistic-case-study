# Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of data from **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. The overall objective is to uncover insights to develop a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. By analyzing Cyclistic’s bike trip data, we aim to understand how different types of customers use the service and identify opportunities to encourage casual riders to purchase annual memberships.

### The analysis will seek to answer the following questions:
1. How do the number of rides, average ride duration, and ride distance differ between casual riders and subscribing members?
2. Which days (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends) and seasons see the highest usage from casual riders and subscribing members?"
3. What are the most popular locations for casual riders?
4. Which bike types are most frequently used by casual riders, and how does this compare to those of subscribing members?

# Data Source
The analysis is based on **Cyclistic’s** CSV trip data, which includes information about each ride taken with the service over the past year. The dataset covers various aspects of the rides, such as start/end times, station names, ride length, and user type (casual or subscribing member). You can access the updated data souce [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) or within the [data folder](data) of this repository.

## Importing Data #################################################
The data was originally divided into 13 CSV files, which were merged using the following code. This process involves importing the files into a list, evaluating their structure, and combining them into a single data frame. The data was then verified to be structurally sound before proceeding with the analysis.

**Key things to note:**
- No duplications within the primary key (ride_id)
- Total of 6,584,382 rows

## Data Wrangling #################################################
### Extrapolation of Dates and Ride Length
To prepare for analysis of temporal trends and ride characteristics, several new columns were created:
- **Month** and **Weekday** were extracted from the ride start time to analyze seasonal and weekly patterns.
- **Ride Length** was calculated as the duration of each ride in seconds to compare usage behaviors.
- The term **"members"** was renamed to **"subscribers"** for greater clarity and consistency with the business goal of converting casual riders into subscribing members.


<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

``` r
# Extrapolation of dates
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at)
all_trips$weekday <- weekdays(all_trips$started_at)
all_trips$month <- month(all_trips$started_at, label = T)
all_trips$year <- year(all_trips$started_at)

# Convert weekday into a factor, ensuring days are analyzed in a logical sequence rather than alphabetically.
all_trips$weekday <- ordered(all_trips$weekday,
                             levels = c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))

# Verify the class of our weekday variable
class(all_trips$weekday)

# Calculate ride length
all_trips$ride_length_sec <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at, all_trips$started_at)

# convert ride_length_sec to numeric format
all_trips$ride_length_sec <- as.numeric(all_trips$ride_length_sec)

# rename member to subscriber
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual,"member" = "subscriber"))
```
</details>







### Addressing Missing Station Names #################################################
To enhance data accuracy and completeness, missing station names and IDs were populated using the coordinates of known stations. This process ensured that:
- Missing start and end station names/IDs were filled when possible using station coordinates.
- Stations with ambiguous coordinates (e.g., multiple stations sharing the same coordinates) were excluded to maintain data reliability.

#### Recovered Stations Names and Id's

#### Boxplot of Ride Distribution
The boxplot below portrays the distribution of ride lengths, segmented by bike type. It clearly illustrates how **extreme outliers distort the dataset**.
- The extreme outliers, marked in red, are significantly larger than the interquartile range (IQR), skewing the overall representation of ride lengths.
- These outliers predominantly affect the docked bike category, suggesting possible data recording issues or anomalies specific to this type.

#### Cleaning Erroneous Data and Calculating Distance
Additional data cleaning was conducted to address invalid trips and calculate the distances traveled:

- **Distance Calculation:** The Haversine formula was applied to calculate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between start and end points for each ride.
- **Filtering Invalid Trips:** The following were identified as invalid and excluded:
  1. Rides with non-positive durations.
  2. Rides with zero distances lasting 60 seconds or less.
  3. Rides originating from the test station: *Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station*
- **Handling Missing Values:** NA values and flagged invalid trips were removed to ensure data consistency.

``` r
# Calculate the distance using the Haversine formula (Output is in meters)
# This is euclidean distance and is not a reflection of of road network distance
all_trips2 <- all_trips2 %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(geo_distance_meters = distHaversine(c(start_lng, start_lat), c(end_lng, end_lat)))

# Filter and examine erroneous data
invalid_trips <- all_trips2 %>% 
  filter((ride_length_sec <= 0 |
            (geo_distance_meters == 0 & ride_length_sec <= 60)) |
           start_station_name == "Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station")

### 2. Which days (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends) and seasons see the highest usage from casual riders and subscribing members #######################
**Key Findings**


Weekdays vs. Weekends:

- Casual riders primarily use the service on weekends, reflecting recreational or leisure use.
- Subscribers show consistent usage throughout the week, indicating routine commutes or errands.


Seasonality:
- Casual riders show a strong preference for warmer months (May to September), with a significant decline in usage during winter.
- Subscribers maintain steady usage across all seasons, with slight increases during spring and summer.

#### Weekly Ride Count

# Conclusion
## Key Findings
#### General
- Ride usage peaks during warmer months, with September seeing the highest activity and January the lowest.
- Casual riders account for 41.32% of rides, while subscribers make up 58.67%.
- Classic bikes are the most popular choice for both groups, followed by electric bikes.
- Outliers in ride length, especially for docked bikes, highlight potential data accuracy issues.

#### Casual Riders
- Casual riders average longer trips at 25 minutes compared to 12 minutes for subscribers.
- Casual users dominate weekend rides, showing greater variability and are likely due to recreational use.

#### Annual Subscribing Members
- Subscribers consistently use the service throughout the week, with no significant drop-off between weekdays and weekends.
- Annual subscribing members consistently use the service for shorter, more frequent rides, indicating commuting or routine travel.



## Recommendations 
#### 1. Introduce Additional Membership Options

Introduce flexible membership options that would cater towards current casual riders. A tier membership that would allow for weekend riders to subscribe to "Weekend Memberships or “Seasonal Passes” could leverage peak times for the casual base.

#### 2. Enhance Access to Preferred Bike Types

While classic bikes are the most used, this may be due to limited availability of electric bikes. By verifying rider preferences and ensuring a sufficient supply of preferred bikes at key locations, we can attract more riders and improve satisfaction.

#### 3. Promote a Sense of Community

Create engaging features that allow riders to track and share ride statistics, achievements, or distances. Casual riders may find value in competing with friends or unlocking rewards for completing milestones. 

#### 4. Offer Exclusive Perks for Subscribers
Provide added value for subscribers through benefits like priority access to electric bikes or discounts at businesses near high-traffic stations. This could make it more appealing for casual riders to considering an upgrade.
